# RealWorld Premium Shop — Frontend (HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript)

A professional, premium-looking front-end e-commerce platform demo built with semantic HTML5, modern CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. This is a static, client-side app ready to run on GitHub Pages — no backend required.

Highlights
- Responsive, accessible UI with modern visual design
- Featured carousel that auto-advances every 3 seconds (smooth right → left)
- Product catalog loaded from JSON (assets/data/products.json)
- Search, category filters, price range, rating filter, sorting
- Product quick view modal, deep links ready (hash-based)
- Persistent cart in localStorage, cart sidebar with quantity controls and totals
- Mock checkout form with client-side validation

How to use (for non-developers)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (if you don't have one).
   - Name it e.g., `realworld-shop`.
2. In your repository, create these files preserving the folders:
   - index.html
   - README.md
   - assets/css/styles.css
   - assets/js/app.js
   - assets/data/products.json
3. Commit and push to the `main` branch.

Publish with GitHub Pages
1. Open your repo on GitHub → Settings → Pages (or Code and automation → Pages).
2. Under "Build and deployment" select:
   - Source: Branch `main` (root)
3. Save. After a minute your site will be available at:
   - https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
4. If you want the project to publish at https://<your-username>.github.io/, create a repository named `<your-username>.github.io` and push the same files to the `main` branch.

Notes & customization
- Products: edit assets/data/products.json to add, remove or update products and images.
- Currency: UI shows Indian rupee symbol (₹). You can change text in templates to use other currency symbols if needed.
- For real orders/payments: connect a backend and Stripe/PayPal. This demo intentionally does not process payments.
- I included smooth animations for the featured carousel and polished UI interactions to make it feel premium.

If you want, I can:
- Push these files into a new GitHub repository for you and enable Pages automatically (provide repo name & whether to push to `main` or create a branch).
- Add a simple GitHub Action workflow that auto-deploys to Pages on push.
- Integrate a lightweight serverless function (Netlify/AWS/GitHub Actions) for storing orders or connecting Stripe (test mode).
